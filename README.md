# RotatingFlashlight
This was an excercise in creating interesting shapes with CSS psuedo elements, which morphed into some manual animation. 
The flashlight rotates in response to the user's mouse position. Significantly this project involved a number of math calculations to get the angle of rotation based on the flashlight's origin and the relative position of the user's mouse cursor.
